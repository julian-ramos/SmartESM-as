    <string name="purposeTitle">Purpose of this Study</string>
    <string name="purposeContent">You are being asked to volunteer for a research project 
        studying your behavior when using mobile devices. The study will explore how people
        on their mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) go through their everyday activities. 
        Based on the finding of the study we will propose and implement designs which will 
        enable faster and easier use of applications on future mobile devices.\n</string>
    <string name="procedureTitle">Procedures</string>
    <string name="procedureContent">In order to study your daily mobile device use, we will 
        ask you to install an application that will monitor your device use on your mobile 
        device. Upon installation, the application will ask you to accept this consent form 
        in order to take part in the study. You will be able to use the application only if 
        you give your consent. The application will collect information about other 
        applications that you install, invoke, and use on the device. In addition, the 
        application will unobtrusively collect other contextual information that will help 
        us understand the context in which you interact with your device: current time, cell 
        tower IDs, WiFi access point information, location information, screen status, 
        battery status, network status, and call and SMS events. The locations information 
        will also used for the purpose of activity recognition. The application will store 
        this information on your device and transmit this information to one of our servers 
        over secure connection. The application will also ask you some questions that will 
        pop-up based on some triggers. Your answers to these questions will also be stored 
        on the device and transmitted with the other data.\n\nThe study will last 4 weeks. 
        After 2 weeks, there will be a slight change in the application but the data 
        collected will be the same.\n</string>
    <string name="requirementsTitle">Participant Requirements</string>
    <string name="requirementsContent">You must be 18 years old or older, and own and use an 
        Android mobile device on regular basis.\n</string>
    <string name="risksTitle">Risks</string>
    <string name="risksContent">The risks and discomfort associated with participation in 
        this study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life when 
        using a mobile device (e.g., a cell phone). The only additional discomfort would be 
        that you would have to answer the questions. The only risk is associated with privacy 
        of the data collected. Confidentiality section below describes how this risk is 
        managed.\n</string>
    <string name="benefitsTitle">Benefits</string>
    <string name="benefitsContent">There may be no personal benefit from your participation
